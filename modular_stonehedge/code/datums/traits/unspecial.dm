//BE SPECIAL converted most to regular quirk traits for consistency in characters -- vide noir.
//Will need rebalancing costs and stuff.

// 2-4/(-2) cost for minor game affecting positive and negative quirks
// 5-6/(-4) cost for moderate quirks
// 7-10/(-6)-(-12) cost for major quirks
// 15/(-10)-(-15) cost for quirks that can drastically affect the game

// These values can vary, but this should help establish a standard. 
// Try to keep negatives a lower point gain than positives require, especially if they affect the same thing.*
// *This is to prevent some quirks from being free, especially if they cancel eachother out to a positive degree.

// Keep skill ups to 3, as well.

// If everyone's special, then noone is.
