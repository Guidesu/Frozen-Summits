	name = "Faithless"
	desc = "The Faithless are those who deny the gods or refuse to honor any divine power, relying solely on their own will. While this defiance may grant a sense of independence in life, it carries dire consequences in death. In the realms where gods are real and their influence undeniable, the souls of the Faithless are condemned to the Wall of the Faithlessâ€”a grim fate in the City of Judgment where they are trapped and dissolved into nothingness for eternity. To walk the path of the Faithless is to embrace oblivion."
